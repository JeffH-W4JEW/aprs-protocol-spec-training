# Instructions to Contributors

The APRS Protocol Reference is the lifeblood of the APRS protocol. The APRS Protocol offers compatability across numerous networks, systems, and devices, all thanks to those in the APRS Working Group that developed the standard. Without standards, it would not be possible to ensure compatability between disparate systems.

## Custodian & Licensing

APRS Foundation Inc. ("The Foundation") is the owner and maintainer of the APRS Protocol Specification - effective February 1, 2024.

There are a multitude of open-source licenses available. The Foundation will review the options available. In the meantime, please reach out to the APRS Foundation with any requests.

## You Can Contribute

The APRS Protocol Reference has gone largely unmaintained for several years. There have been minor additions and modifications, but for all intents and purposes, the document has been passed around the global amateur radio community for several years without any semblence of tracking, version control, or other commonly accepted methods of maintaining documentation.

## The Current Goal - Feature Parity

There will undoubtedbly be cases where members of the APRS community wish to propose enhancements and mofidications to the APRS Protocol Specifciation. We are not ready for that yet. We still have some catching up to do before we can get to that point.

The documentation has largely been maintained in Microsoft Word and PDF formats. It's even been converted from Word to PDF, then from PDF back to Word as nobody knew who held the most current version of the documentation in an editable form. The conversion process destroyed the formatting!

There is a lot of tediuous work that needs to be done in order to unify the format of the document.

Just as we use KISS in the APRS world to inteface with TNCs - we're going to employ KISS to the cleanup effort!

The Foundation selected GitHub as the official respository due to it being so well-suited for collaboration while maintaining strict version control.

Furthermore, Markdown was selected as the common format for all structured documentation maintained by The Foundation. It is easy to learn, simple to use, and ensures uniformity with consistent results. Additionally, Markdown can easily be rendered into HTML, PDF, ePub, and a multitude of other formats without needing to make any changes to the source.

## Contributing

If you are interested in making contributions to the clean-up process, you will need to be familiar with the following:

1. Utilizing GitHub processes to make a copy of the documentation and submit your edits
2. Use Markdown language

Don't worry! This will be painless! We are here to support you every step of the way! You'll be seasoned experts in no time!

## Markdown

Editing Markdown is not much diferent than editing a text document. The developers of Markdown found it was possible to create structured documentation in text by introducing formatting conventions. As long as the formatting conventions are used, and used consistently, the documents can be fed into a rendering process to produce content that is absolutely gorgeous!

If you haven't used Markdown before, you're gonna love it!

If you can edit text - you are already 50% of the way towards learning Markdown!

You know you loved it!!! 10 more minutes wouldn't hurt (too badly) would it?

The documentation is maintained in Strict Markdown (vanilla unextended) format and is processed through [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) (a static site generator) to webify the content.

## GitHub - Fork, Clone, Pull

> _Let's Do The Time Warp Again..._

Any time you want to work on the documentation, you can:

[Fork the existing repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

## Tools

### GitHub

If you don't already have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account...

Were you born under a rock? Go get one! You're gonna need it! :-)

### Git or GitHub Desktop

If you're one of the kool kidz and hang with the [l337](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet), we salute you! You can rock _git_ all day!

Some of us aren't that cool. And, GUIs aren't as nerdy as they might seem. We won't fault you if you want to use one (or two) to make life easier.

> _...psst! We use them too!_

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a phenomenal application! It's available for Windows & macOS. There are derivatives of GitHub Desktop for Linux (GitKracken), but Linux users would likely get ostracized for using a GUI to perform git functions.

### Visual Studio Code

Remember how Microsoft was always the target of everyone's critcism? Yeah - well forget it. Those days are in the past. Visual Studio Code is the most popular IDE around. It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL! Everyone uses it these days.

And...it's free (as in beer)!

Download it _DIRECTLY_ from the official [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

VS Code has excellent support for Markdown including Live Preview (it shows you what your Markdown looks like after its been rendered) and it has a built in Markdown "linter". This is like a spell-checker, but for code! If you make mistakes, it's OK. VS Code will alert you and provide suggestions.

### Markdown WISIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)

> _Why would I need a graphical application if you said Markdown is text?_

I'm glad you asked! We rely on Markdown because, as long as the formatting conventions are applied correctly, it can be converted into gorgeous documentation. But that does require you to become savvy with Markdown.

Now, we're confident you'll get better with it over time, but as you get acquainted with it, you might want to rely on a WYSIWYG that gives you the same look and feel of working in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, but saves the data in Markdown format (.md file extesion).

Here are several options for you to choose from:

[Typora](https://typora.io/) our favorite! But, there is a cost associated with it ($14.99 USD). It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux and you can install it on up to three computers simultaneously.
